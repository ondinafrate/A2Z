  <textarea cols=100 rows=20 id="input">Bali is a tiny Hindu island located in the middle of the two-thousand-mile-long Indonesian
archipelago that constitutes the most populous Muslim nation on earth. Bali is therefore a
strange and wondrous thing; it should not even exist, yet does. The island’s Hinduism was an
export from India by way of Java. Indian traders brought the religion east during the fourth
century AD. The Javanese kings founded a mighty Hindu dynasty, little of which remains
today except the impressive temple ruins at Borobudur. In the sixteenth century, a violent Islamic
uprising swept across the region and the Shiva-worshipping Hindu royalty escaped
Java, fleeing to Bali in droves during what would be remembered as the Majapahit Exodus.
The high-class, high-caste Javanese brought with them to Bali only their royal families, their
craftsmen and their priests—and so it is not a wild exaggeration when people say that everyone
in Bali is the descendent of either a king, a priest or an artist, and that this is why the
Balinese have such pride and brilliance.
The Javanese colonists brought their Hindu caste system with them to Bali, though caste
divisions were never as brutally enforced here as they once were in India. Still, the Balinese
recognize a complex social hierarchy (there are five divisions of Brahmans alone) and I would
have better luck personally decoding the human genome than trying to understand the intricate,
interlocking clan system that still thrives here. (The writer Fred B. Eiseman’s many fine
essays on Balinese culture go much further into expert detail explaining these subtleties, and
it is from his research that I take most of my general information, not only here but throughout
this book.) Suffice it to say for our purposes that everyone in Bali is in a clan, that everyone
knows which clan he is in, and that everyone knows which clan everyone else is in. And if you
get kicked out of your clan for some grave disobedience, you really might as well jump into a
volcano, because, honestly, you’re as good as dead.
Balinese culture is one of the most methodical systems of social and religious organization
on earth, a magnificent beehive of tasks and roles and ceremonies. The Balinese are lodged,
completely held, within an elaborate lattice of customs. A combination of several factors created
this network, but basically we can say that Bali is what happens when the lavish rituals of
traditional Hinduism are superimposed over a vast rice-growing agricultural society that oper-
ates, by necessity, with elaborate communal cooperation. Rice terraces require an unbelievable
amount of shared labor, maintenance and engineering in order to prosper, so each
Balinese village has a banjar—a united organization of citizens who administer, through consensus,
the village’s political and economic and religious and agricultural decisions. In Bali,
the collective is absolutely more important than the individual, or nobody eats.
